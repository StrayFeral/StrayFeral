- 👋 Hi, I’m @StrayFeral
- 👀 I’m interested in making music and software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a good father.
- 💞️ (I’m looking to collaborate on) (nope, strike that out at the moment)
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter, Insta, Facebook. At the moment I won't post my LinkedIn profile.
